They'll make an effort. They'll sweep you off your feet. But what happens when that pursuit becomes overwhelming? When the effort feels suffocating? When being swept off your feet leaves you dizzy and disoriented?</p>\r\n                        \r\n                        <p>The line between romantic pursuit and love bombing can be razor-thin, especially in the early stages of dating. Both involve attention, affection, and grand gestures. Both can make you feel special and desired. The difference lies in the intention behind the behavior and what happens when the initial intensity inevitably fades.</p>\r\n                        \r\n                        <p>I learned this lesson the hard way.
