After years of adapting to other people's needs, walking on eggshells, and having my reality constantly questioned, I genuinely didn't know. I knew what I didn't want—a list so long it could fill a novella. But what I actually wanted? That felt like a foreign concept.</p>\r\n                        \r\n                        <p>This is what they don't tell you about dating after trauma: you don't just need to find the right person. You need to find yourself first. And that's a lot harder than it sounds when trauma has rewired your nervous system to see danger in healthy behaviors and safety in familiar toxicity.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"quote-box\">\r\n                            \"Trauma makes you doubt your own instincts—the very thing you need most to stay safe.\"\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                    \r\n                    <section>\r\n                        <h2>The Hypervigilance Phase: When Everyone Feels Dangerous</h2>\r\n                        \r\n                        <p>For the first year after escaping my worst relationship, I lived in a constant state of high alert. My nervous system was stuck in fight-or-flight mode, scanning every new person for signs of manipulation, control, or deception.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"healing-stage\">\r\n                            <div class=\"stage-number\">STAGE 1</div>\r\n                            <h3>The Trauma Response</h3>\r\n                            <p>Normal, healthy behaviors triggered my alarm bells. Someone being consistently kind felt suspicious. Respect for my boundaries seemed too good to be true. Genuine interest in my thoughts and feelings made me wonder what they wanted from me.</p>\r\n                            \r\n                            <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> I went on a coffee date with someone who asked thoughtful questions about my writing. Instead of feeling flattered, I spent the entire evening analyzing his motives. Why was he so interested? What was he trying to get from me? It took months to realize that healthy people are actually curious about their dates.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"self-care-tip\">\r\n                            <span class=\"self-care-icon\">💚</span>\r\n                            <strong>Healing Tip:</strong> Hypervigilance is your nervous system trying to protect you. Don't judge it—acknowledge it. \"Thank you, nervous system, for trying to keep me safe. I'm not in danger right now.\"\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n\r\n                    \r\n                    <section>\r\n                        <h2>Rebuilding Trust: The Slow Road Back to Intuition</h2>\r\n                        \r\n                        <p>Learning to trust your gut again after it's been systematically undermined is like physical therapy for your intuition. You have to start small and build up slowly.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"healing-stage\">\r\n                            <div class=\"stage-number\">STAGE 2</div>\r\n                            <h3>Micro-Decisions</h3>\r\n                            <p>I started with tiny choices outside of dating. Which coffee shop felt right today? Did I want to take the train or walk? What movie actually sounded appealing, not just acceptable?</p>\r\n                            \r\n                            <p>These micro-decisions helped me reconnect with my own preferences after years of deferring to other people's wants. Slowly, I remembered what my own voice sounded like.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"healing-stage\">\r\n                            <div class=\"stage-number\">STAGE 3</div>\r\n                            <h3>Body Wisdom</h3>\r\n                            <p>Trauma lives in the body, but so does intuition. I learned to pay attention to physical sensations when meeting new people. Did my shoulders tense up? Did I feel energized or drained? Did I want to lean in or step back?</p>\r\n                            \r\n                            <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> I met someone for drinks who seemed perfect on paper—charming, successful, funny. But my body felt heavy around them. My stomach was tight. I used to ignore these signals, but now I trust them completely. Three months later, mutual friends warned me he had a reputation for emotional manipulation.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"self-care-tip\">\r\n                            <span class=\"self-care-icon\">🎯</span>\r\n                            <strong>Practice Exercise:</strong> Before making any decision, pause and ask your body: \"What feels right here?\" Notice the first sensation that comes up. That's your intuition speaking.\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n\r\n                    \r\n                    <section>\r\n                        <h2>Boundaries: Building Walls That Have Gates</h2>\r\n                        \r\n                        <p>Trauma survivors often struggle with boundaries—we either have none or we build fortress walls that no one can penetrate. The goal is healthy boundaries: walls with gates that we control.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"healing-stage\">\r\n                            <div class=\"stage-number\">STAGE 4</div>\r\n                            <h3>Learning to Say No</h3>\r\n                            <p>After years of having my \"no\" ignored, negotiated, or punished, I had to relearn that \"no\" is a complete sentence. Not \"no, because...\" or \"no, but maybe later.\" Just no.</p>\r\n                            \r\n                            <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> Someone asked me out on a date that would require a two-hour drive each way. The old me would have said yes to seem agreeable. The healing me said, \"That doesn't work for me, but I'd be happy to meet somewhere closer.\" When they respected that boundary without argument, I knew they were worth a second conversation.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"healing-stage\">\r\n                            <div class=\"stage-number\">STAGE 5</div>\r\n                            <h3>Testing Boundaries Early</h3>\r\n                            <p>I started setting small boundaries early in dating to see how people responded. Did they respect my preference for texting over calling? Did they accept when I needed to reschedule? How did they handle me saying no to sex on the third date?</p>\r\n                            \r\n                            <p>Healthy people respect boundaries without making you explain or justify them.
