Maybe they mention wanting to go back to school, start a business, or leave their toxic job. You begin offering advice, connections, emotional support.

Once you understand the psychology, you can reprogram your attraction patterns. Here's how:</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h3>Step 1: Audit Your Dating History</h3>\r\n                        <p>Look for patterns in your past relationships. What common traits did your problematic partners share? What role did you consistently play? Write it downâ€”seeing it on paper makes the patterns undeniable.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h3>Step 2: Separate Potential from Reality</h3>\r\n                        <p>Create two lists when evaluating someone: who they are now versus who they could become. Only date the first list. Potential is not a relationship foundationâ€”it's a business plan.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h3>Step 3: Practice Emotional Boundaries</h3>\r\n                        <p>Stop trying to solve other people's problems. Your role in a relationship is to be a partner, not a life coach, therapist, or project manager. Love someone as they are, not as a renovation project.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h3>Step 4: Redefine Your Standards</h3>\r\n                        <p>Intelligence isn't enough. Look for emotional intelligence, consistency, and follow-through. A partner should enhance your life, not become your life's work.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h3>Step 5: Embrace Boring Stability</h3>\r\n                        <p>Drama isn't passionâ€”it's exhaustion. Healthy relationships might feel \"boring\" compared to toxic rollercoasters, but boring is where happiness lives.</p>\r\n                    </section>\r\n\r\n                    \r\n                    <section>\r\n                        <h2>Real Talk: How I Finally Broke My Pattern</h2>\r\n                        \r\n                        <p>My breakthrough came with The Planner (Chapter 11 in my book).
