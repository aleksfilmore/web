<h3>Your Body, Your Space</h3>\r\n                            <p><strong>What they protect:</strong> Personal space, physical touch, belongings, home</p>\r\n                            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> \"I need you to ask before hugging me,\" \"Please don't go through my phone,\" \"I'm not comfortable with overnight guests yet\"</p>\r\n
