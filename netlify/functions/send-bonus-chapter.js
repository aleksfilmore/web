                    </div>

                    <p>Dear brave reader,</p>
                    
                    <p>You asked for it, and here it is ‚Äì the story that was "too much" even for a book about the worst boyfriends ever. This is the tale of Marcus, also known as "The One I Almost Married But Didn't Because The Universe Has a Sense of Humor."</p>

                    <div class="chapter-content">
                        <h3>Chapter 21: The One That Got Away (Thank God)</h3>
                        
                        <p><em>Setting: A coffee shop in downtown, three years ago. I'm wearing my "good" jeans and actually brushed my hair. Red flag #1: I was trying too hard.</em></p>

                        <p>Marcus walked into Starbucks like he owned the place. Not in a confident way, but literally like he expected free coffee because his mere presence graced their establishment. He was tall, had that messy-but-intentional hair, and was wearing a vintage band t-shirt that I later learned cost $200. Because apparently, looking broke is expensive.</p>

                        <p>"Nice book," he said, sliding into the seat across from me uninvited. I was reading "Pride and Prejudice" for the fourth time because I'm basic like that.</p>

                        <p>"Thanks," I replied, immediately closing it because God forbid I seem too intellectual on a Tuesday afternoon.</p>

                        <p>"I'm more of a Bukowski guy myself," he continued, and I should have run right then. Any man who volunteers his love for Charles Bukowski within the first thirty seconds of conversation is telling you exactly who he is. Believe him.</p>

                        <p>But did I listen to my instincts? Of course not. I was charmed by his "mysterious artist" vibe and the way he ordered his coffee ‚Äì black, no sugar, with the kind of dramatic sigh that suggested caffeine was both his salvation and his curse.</p>

                        <p>Three months later, I discovered that Marcus was:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A "freelance creative" (unemployed)</li>
                            <li>Living in his ex-girlfriend's basement (while she lived upstairs)</li>
                            <li>Convinced that showering more than twice a week was "giving in to societal pressure"</li>
                            <li>The proud owner of seventeen plants that he talked to daily (their names were all literary characters)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The breaking point came when he suggested we move in together. Not to an apartment ‚Äì to a converted van he wanted to buy with my savings account. The van, he explained, would allow us to "live authentically" while he "found his artistic voice."</p>

                        <p>I said no. He said I was "too materialistic" and "afraid of real love." I said he was right, and thank you for the clarification.</p>

                        <p>The funny thing about dodging bullets is that you don't always realize how close they came until much later. Last month, I ran into Marcus at the grocery store. He was arguing with a cashier about whether quinoa should be pronounced "KEEN-wah" or "kee-NO-ah" like it was a matter of international importance.</p>

                        <p>He's still unemployed. Still living in that basement. Still unwashed.</p>

                        <p>But now he has a girlfriend who thinks his "anti-establishment lifestyle" is "inspiring." She was with him at the store, nodding along to his quinoa pronunciation lecture like he was delivering the Gettysburg Address.</p>

                        <p>And you know what? I'm happy for them. Really. Because somewhere out there is a woman who thinks that smelling like patchouli and existential dread is the height of romance, and Marcus deserves to find his person.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, I'm dating someone who showers daily, has a job, and lives in his own apartment. Revolutionary, I know.</p>

                        <p>The moral of this story? Sometimes the one that got away didn't get away ‚Äì you just finally developed enough self-respect to let them go.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>And that, my dear readers, is why I never trust a man who pronounces quinoa with passion.</strong></p>
