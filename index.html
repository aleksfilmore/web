        <h2>Fogbound Hearts</h2>
        <p>When Daniel inherits a crumbling mansion in the forgotten town of Eldermist, he expects dust, maybe ghosts. What he finds is a town drowning in fog and secrets. An abandoned lighthouse. A stranger with eyes like storms. A journal that bleeds memory and madness. As his bond with the mysterious Simon deepens, so does the pull of the ancient curse that haunts the cliffs.</p>
        <p><em>Fogbound Hearts</em> is a haunting tale of queer love, psychological suspense, and a fog that never forgives.</p>
