        <h2>Fogbound Hearts</h2>
        <p>When Daniel inherits a crumbling mansion in the forgotten town of Eldermist, he expects dust, maybe ghosts. What he finds is a town drowning in fog and secrets. An abandoned lighthouse. A stranger with eyes like storms. A journal that bleeds memory and madness. As his bond with the mysterious Simon deepens, so does the pull of the ancient curse that haunts the cliffs.</p>
        <p><em>Fogbound Hearts</em> is a haunting tale of queer love, psychological suspense, and a fog that never forgives.</p>

        <h2>Dacia Rising</h2>
        <p>A mythic saga forged in the fires of ancient Dacia. As the Roman Empire looms, a young warrior, a high priestess, and a cursed bear must unite the fractured tribes under one banner. Battles rage. Secrets awaken. Destiny roars through the Carpathians. This is more than a fight for freedom—it’s a war for the soul of a forgotten kingdom.</p>
        <p><em>Dacia Rising</em> is a sweeping epic of prophecy, pagan power, and a legacy lost in the mists of time.</p>
