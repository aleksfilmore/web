# üîó Stripe Webhook Setup Guide
## Configure Stripe to send payment notifications to your website

### üìç BEFORE YOU START
Make sure your website is deployed and accessible at your live URL. If you haven't deployed yet, you can still set up the webhook but you'll need to update the URL later.

### üéØ STEP-BY-STEP WEBHOOK CONFIGURATION

#### Step 1: Access Stripe Dashboard
1. Go to [https://dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Make sure you're in **Live mode** (toggle in top-left should show "Live")
3. Navigate to **Developers** ‚Üí **Webhooks**

#### Step 2: Create New Webhook Endpoint
1. Click **"Add endpoint"** button
2. Fill in the webhook details:

**Endpoint URL:** `https://aleksfilmore.com/webhook`
*(Replace aleksfilmore.com with your actual domain)*

**Description:** `Aleks Filmore Website - Order Processing`

#### Step 3: Select Events to Listen For
In the "Events to send" section, select these specific events:
- ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed` (REQUIRED)
- ‚úÖ `payment_intent.succeeded` (Optional but recommended)
- ‚úÖ `invoice.payment_succeeded` (For subscription support if added later)

**Quick Selection Method:**
- Click **"Select events"**
- Search for "checkout.session.completed"
- Check the box next to it
- Click **"Add events"**

#### Step 4: Save and Get Webhook Secret
1. Click **"Add endpoint"** to create the webhook
2. You'll be redirected to the webhook details page
3. Look for **"Signing secret"** section
4. Click **"Reveal"** to show the webhook secret
5. Copy the secret (starts with `whsec_`)

#### Step 5: Update Your Environment Variables
Open your `.env` file and update:
```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_actual_webhook_secret_here
```

### üß™ TESTING YOUR WEBHOOK

#### Option 1: Test with Stripe CLI (Recommended for development)
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
# Download from: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases

# Login to Stripe
stripe login

# Forward events to your local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/webhook
```

#### Option 2: Test with Live Payments
1. Start your server locally: `node server.js`
2. Use ngrok to expose your local server:
   ```bash
   # Install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
   ngrok http 3000
   ```
3. Update webhook URL to your ngrok URL: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/webhook`
4. Make a test purchase

### üîß WEBHOOK ENDPOINT DETAILS

**Your webhook endpoint handles these events:**
- **checkout.session.completed**: Triggered when payment is successful

### üö® COMMON WEBHOOK ISSUES & FIXES
