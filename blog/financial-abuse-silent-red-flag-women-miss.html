                            They called it "helping with finances." I called it love. But when I couldn't buy coffee without permission, I realized this wasn't protection—it was prison. Here's how financial abuse works and how to break free.

                        <p>It started innocently enough. "Let me handle the bills, babe. You have enough stress at work." He set up autopay for everything, consolidated our accounts, and handled all the "boring money stuff." I felt taken care of, protected even.</p>
                        
                        <p>Six months later, I was standing in a coffee shop, my card declined for a $4 latte. When I called him, confused and embarrassed, he sighed like I was a child who'd lost her lunch money. "You overspent this week. I had to adjust your limit."</p>
                        
                        <p>That's when it hit me: I had no access to my own money. No idea what we had or where it went. I was 28 years old and asking permission to buy coffee.</p>

                        <p>Financial abuse is the most overlooked form of domestic violence, affecting nearly 8 out of 10 abuse survivors. It's insidious because it masquerades as care, love, or traditional gender roles. But make no mistake—controlling someone's access to money is about controlling their ability to leave.</p>

                        <p>Financial abuse is the illegal or unauthorized use of a person's money, property, or assets. It's a form of domestic violence that involves controlling a victim's ability to acquire, use, and maintain financial resources.</p>

                            <h3>Key Warning: Financial abuse is never about money—it's about power.</h3>
                            <p>The goal isn't to save money or "be responsible." It's to create dependence, limit options, and maintain control.</p>

                        <h2>The Tactics: How Financial Abuse Unfolds</h2>
                        
                        <p>Financial abusers use sophisticated strategies that often start subtly and escalate over time. Here are the most common tactics:</p>

                            <h3>Taking Over Financial Management</h3>
                            <p><strong>How it looks:</strong> "Let me handle the bills, you're so busy" or "I'm better with money than you are."</p>
                            <p><strong>What's really happening:</strong> They're gaining control of all accounts, passwords, and financial decisions. You lose visibility into your own finances.</p>
                            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> He insisted on handling all our finances because I was "too stressed" from work. Within months, I had no idea what we earned, spent, or owed. When I asked to see our bank statements, he accused me of not trusting him.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Workplace Interference</h3>
                            <p><strong>How it looks:</strong> Constant calls/texts during work, showing up unannounced, creating drama that affects your job performance.</p>
                            <p><strong>What's really happening:</strong> They're trying to get you fired or make you quit so you become financially dependent.</p>
                            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> He would call me 15+ times during important meetings, claiming "emergencies" that were never real emergencies. When my boss mentioned the disruptions, he convinced me to quit "for our relationship."</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Excessive Spending Surveillance</h3>
                            <p><strong>How it looks:</strong> Questioning every purchase, demanding receipts, setting arbitrary spending limits, monitoring bank statements obsessively.</p>
                            <p><strong>What's really happening:</strong> They're creating an environment where you feel guilty for any financial independence.</p>
                            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> I had to text him before buying anything over $20. Groceries, gas, even work supplies. He'd quiz me about every line item and make me feel wasteful for buying basic necessities.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="financial-tactic">

                            <h3>Secret Financial Obligations</h3>
                            <p><strong>How it looks:</strong> Opening accounts in your name, using your credit, taking out loans or credit cards without your knowledge.</p>
                            <p><strong>What's really happening:</strong> They're creating financial chaos that makes leaving seem impossible.</p>
                            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> I discovered he'd opened three credit cards in my name and maxed them out. My credit score went from 780 to 520 in six months. Leaving meant dealing with debt I didn't even know existed.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Blocking Access to Resources</h3>
                            <p><strong>How it looks:</strong> Hiding assets, denying access to bank accounts, refusing to provide money for basic needs, controlling passwords and account access.</p>
                            <p><strong>What's really happening:</strong> They're creating artificial scarcity to maintain control.</p>
                            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> He removed my name from our joint account but kept me responsible for joint bills. I had no access to money but was still liable for our shared expenses.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Financial abuse is particularly insidious because it often masquerades as caring, traditional, or practical behavior. Here's how to see through the disguises:</p>

                        <h2>Breaking Free: My Financial Recovery Journey</h2>
                        
                        <p>Leaving was the hardest thing I've ever done. I had $47 in my secret account, credit cards I didn't know about, and no clear picture of my financial reality. But here's what I learned:</p>

                        <p><strong>The damage wasn't permanent.</strong> Credit can be rebuilt. Debt can be addressed. Bank accounts can be restored. The financial destruction felt overwhelming, but it was fixable.</p>

                        <p><strong>I was stronger than I thought.</strong> Managing my own money wasn't as scary as he'd made it seem. I wasn't "bad with money"—I just hadn't been allowed to practice.</p>

                        <p><strong>Financial independence is everything.</strong> The first time I bought something without asking permission, I cried in the store. Freedom has a price tag, and it's worth every penny.</p>
