                            After years of having my boundaries ignored, negotiated, and demolished, I had to learn to say "no" all over again. Here's your complete guide to rebuilding healthy boundaries and protecting your energy after toxic relationships.
                        </p>

                    <div class="mb-8">
                        <p>The first time I set a boundary after my toxic relationship, my hands were shaking. It was something small—asking someone not to call me after 10 PM—but it felt like I was performing surgery on myself. I'd become so used to accommodating everyone else's needs that advocating for my own felt foreign and terrifying.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you've been in a toxic relationship, your boundary muscles are probably atrophied. You might not even remember what your preferences are, let alone feel entitled to enforce them. The good news? Boundaries are a skill, and skills can be rebuilt.</p>
                        
                        <p>This isn't just about saying "no" more often. It's about rediscovering who you are beneath all the people-pleasing and creating a life that actually serves you.</p>

                        <p>Boundaries aren't walls to keep people out—they're guidelines for how you want to be treated. Think of them as the operating instructions for interacting with you.</p>

                        <h2>Remember: Boundaries Are Self-Care</h2>
                        
                        <p>After toxic relationships, setting boundaries can feel mean or selfish. It's not. Boundaries are how you take care of yourself so you can show up authentically in your relationships.</p>

                        <p>The people who truly care about you will respect your boundaries because they want you to feel safe and comfortable. The people who fight your boundaries are telling you exactly who they are—listen to them.</p>

                        <p>You're not responsible for managing other people's reactions to your boundaries. You're only responsible for clearly communicating them and consistently maintaining them.</p>

                        <p>Start small, be consistent, and trust the process. Every boundary you set and maintain is a vote for the life you want to create.</p>

                                <p class="text-bone/80 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                                    Aleks Filmore is a boundary-setting advocate and author of "The Worst Boyfriends Ever." After years of having his boundaries ignored and violated in toxic relationships, he had to completely rebuild his ability to set and maintain healthy limits. He now helps other survivors reclaim their voice and create relationships built on mutual respect. Currently living boundary-rich in Brussels, where "no" is a complete sentence and no one argues with it.
